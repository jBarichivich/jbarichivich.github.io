## Bio
**I integrate measurements and models to reconstruct and predict the interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the climate system from days to centuries.** To achieve this I work across components of the Earth System and collaborate with colleagues from around the world. My publications and their impact can be found in [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=134gvMcAAAAJ&hl=en).

I hold a MSc in Climate Change and PhD in Environmental Sciences from the world renowned [Climatic Research Unit (CRU)](https://lr1.uea.ac.uk/cru/staff-and-students) of the University of East Anglia, UK. Currently, I am a laureate of the [Make Our Planet Great Again (MOPGA)](https://www.campusfrance.org/fr/system/files/medias/documents/2018-07/Laur%C3%A9ats%20Post%20doctorat%20MOPGA%20Final.pdf) program created by the French Government. In the framework of this program I seek to improve the [terrestrial component](https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2020-446/) of a climate model at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement (LSCE, Paris). 

My research team is distributed in France ([LSCE](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/)), UK ([CRU](https://lr1.uea.ac.uk/cru/staff-and-students) and [University of Leeds](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography)) and South America ([Austral University of Chile](http://www.forestal.uach.cl/instituto/conservacion-biodiversidad-territorio/academicos/jonathan-barichivich.php), [University of Chile](https://www.bosqueciencialab.org/vegetation-dynamics), [Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaíso](https://www.pucv.cl/uuaa/site/edic/base/port/dendrolab.html)). Here I collaborate with colleagues on pressing global change questions using a diverse set of observations and models.

### Research areas

<!--[Global climate and extremes](/sample_page)-->

**a. Global climate and extremes**

One of my primary research activities is on advancing our understanding of processes driving global climate anomalies (climate dynamics) and their feedbacks with the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems (global ecology). 

In a [recent work](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/9/eaat8785) we revealed how the intensification of tropical Walker circulation has driven the observed intensification of the hydrological cycle of the Amazon basin. Contrary to the prevailing view on catastrophic drought in the basin, my research showed that flooding is the hydrological feature that has changed most in recent decades. The frequency of severe floods has increased 5-fold since 1960 because of intensified atmospheric circulation and water vapour transport from a warming tropical Atlantic Ocean. In June 2021, the water level of the Amazon river ([Rio Negro](https://www.portodemanaus.com.br/?pagina=nivel-do-rio-negro-hoje)) in Manaus reached the highest value ever (30.02 m) in the 120 years of daily records.

**b. Reconstructing drought and monitoring the emerging global water crisis**

As part of my work as Associate Fellow in CRU, I lead the yearly assessment of global drought since 2015 in the State of the Climate supplement of the [Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/state-of-the-climate/).

**c. Monitoring and modelling terrestrial ecosystems**

The global ecology component of my research relies on monitoring and modelling of the water and carbon cycle of forest ecosystems. I design and collect my own obervations to advance current process-based understanding in critical areas and improve models useful at different scales. This allows me to pose and answer scientific questions at the forefront of the field. 
<!--My focus is on producing new knowledge on the biophysical processes involved on tree growth by integrating above and belowground components. This allows me to improve modelling of ecosystem dynamics and feedbacks to climate at long time scales from decades to century.-->

My effort on ecosystem monitoring has been dedicated to the establishment of a [supersite](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/CL-ACF) (i.e., fully instrumented ecosystem observatory) in the temperate rain forests of South America as a model to understand the responses of forest ecosystems to climate drying from an integrated above-and below-ground perspective. This biome is undergoing a dramatic drying due to the poleward migration of the storm tracks with climate change and is therefore especially suited to study long-term responses of temperate forests to drought and raising CO2 concentrations under undisturbed nitrogen cycling.

**d. Improving global land surface models at long time scales**

<!--Short-term manipulative global change experiments under controlled conditions (e.g.,FACE) are the backbone of the development, parameterization and benchmarking of current process-based models from plant organs to the global land surface. Current mechanistic understanding of century-scale responses of mature forests to global change factors (e.g., climate, CO2, nitrogen, pollutants) is still limited. Advances in this area are crucial to constrain and improve plant growth representations in next generation global land surface models with the aim of reducing the large uncertainties of projections of the feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to global climate.-->

This research line is at crossroads of climate and ecology and allows me to combine my uniques skills across the components of the Earth system. I seek to develop a new cross-disciplinary framework to constrain climate projections by jointly improving the simulation of forest growth and water use at long time scales (decades to century) using novel observational constraints for historical growth and physiology derived from tree-ring data. This involves developing novel uses of tree-ring data and updating the biology of tree growth in global land surface models to integrate the so-called source-sink growth paradigms.

<!--LSM projections of forest biomass and carbon balance increasingly diverge over longer periods, thus limiting confidence in future climate projections. I am writing research proposals and on how to use new mechanistic insights from tree rings to improve and constrain the responses of the ORCHIDEE global land surface model at long time scales and thereby improve future projections of the state of the land sur- face.-->

**e. Cities as global change experiments**

Altered biogeochemical cycles, with higher CO2 concentrations and significantly stronger warming than in their rural surroundings make cities a natural climate change experiment. Current conditions in metropolitan regions simulate some of those that natural ecosystems will experience with similar intensity in the near future, notably warming. I am exploiting this feature of cities as a convenient alternative to expensive warming experiments. I am testing if urban-rural gradients in mega-cities can be used to study short-term ecosystem responses (e.g., growth extremes) and long-term adaptations (e.g., water use efficiency, stomatal responses) to climate change factors, in particular to warming.

### Teaching and capacity building

I have dedicated a great deal of time to lead efforts for capacity building in order to attract talented students and start a modelling community in South America. Together with [Prof. Alvaro Gutiérrez](http://www.bosqueciencia.org/) (University of Chile) we have been successful in obtaining grants for networking with the ETH ([Harald Bugmann](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.harald-bugmann.html)) and the LSCE ([Philippe Peylin](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/index.php?nom=philippe.peylin)). As a result we have created an annual [Summer School on Vegetation Dynamics](https://www.bosqueciencialab.org/vegetation-dynamics) to start exposing students to modelling from an early career stage (see picture below). 

I have mentored several undergraduate students at the Universidad Austral de Chile and University of Chile. At PhD level, I have co-supervised [Ms. Jina Jeong](https://www.amsterdamecology.nl/phd-students/jina-jeong/) at VU Amsterdam (ongoing) and [Dr. Alienor Lavergne](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.lavergne) formerly at LSCE on modelling tree growth.
