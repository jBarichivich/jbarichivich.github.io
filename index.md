## Research portfolio (in development)

## Bio
**I integrate measurements and models to reconstruct and predict the interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the climate system from days to centuries.** To achieve this I work across components of the Earth System and collaborate with colleagues from around the world. My publications and their impact can be found in [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=134gvMcAAAAJ&hl=en).

I hold a MSc in Climate Change and PhD in Environmental Sciences from the world renowned [Climatic Research Unit (CRU)](https://lr1.uea.ac.uk/cru/staff-and-students) of the University of East Anglia, UK. Currently, I am a laureate of the [Make Our Planet Great Again (MOPGA)](https://www.campusfrance.org/fr/system/files/medias/documents/2018-07/Laur%C3%A9ats%20Post%20doctorat%20MOPGA%20Final.pdf) program created by the French Government. In the framework of this program I seek to improve the [terrestrial component](https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2020-446/) of a climate model at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement (LSCE, Paris). 

My research team is distributed in France ([LSCE](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/)), UK ([CRU](https://lr1.uea.ac.uk/cru/staff-and-students) and [University of Leeds](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography)) and Chile ([Universidad Austral](http://www.forestal.uach.cl/instituto/conservacion-biodiversidad-territorio/academicos/jonathan-barichivich.php), [University of Chile](https://www.bosqueciencialab.org/vegetation-dynamics), [Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaíso](https://www.pucv.cl/uuaa/site/edic/base/port/dendrolab.html)). Here I collaborate with colleagues on pressing global change questions using a diverse set of observations and models.

**Teaching and capacity building**

I have dedicated a great deal of time to lead efforts for capacity building in order to attract talented students and start a modelling community in South America. Together with [Prof. Alvaro Gutiérrez](http://www.bosqueciencia.org/) (University of Chile) we have been successful in obtaining grants for networking with the ETH (Harald Bugmann) and the LSCE (Philippe Peylin). As a result we have created an annual [Summer School on Vegetation Dynamics](https://www.bosqueciencialab.org/vegetation-dynamics) to start exposing students to modelling from an early career stage (see picture below). 

I have mentored several undergraduate students at the Universidad Austral de Chile and University of Chile. At PhD level, I have co-supervised [Ms. Jina Jeong](https://www.amsterdamecology.nl/phd-students/jina-jeong/) at VU Amsterdam (ongoing) and [Dr. Alienor Lavergne](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.lavergne) formerly at LSCE on modelling tree growth.
