**Summary**

Forests cover a third of the vegetated surface of the Earth and interact with global climate. These interactions are being altered by human activities at an unprecedented scale, both in their rate and in their geographical extent. At present, Earth system models (ESMs) struggle to predict how these climate-vegetation interactions will evolve in the future because of varied responses of the carbon cycle in their Land Surface Models (LSMs). This long-standing issue leads to widely varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations and hence varying climate projections under the same scenarios. LSM projections of forest biomass and carbon balance increasingly diverge over longer periods, thus limiting confidence in future climate projections. The goal of this proposal is to develop a new cross-disciplinary framework to constrain climate projections by jointly improving the simulation of forest growth and water use efficiency (WUE; the ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration) at long time scales (decades to century) using novel observational standards for historical growth and physiology derived from tree-ring data. The proposed work will bring into Earth System modelling decades of advances made by dendrochronologists around the world, providing at last a critical long-term constraint for the land surface modelling community as ice-cores are for global circulation models.
<!--The following three objectives are addressed: (1) advance the mechanistic representation of tree-ring growth and stable isotopes in the global LSM ORCHIDEE, the terrestrial component of the IPSL ESM; (2) use tree-ring data together with eddy covariance flux measurements to improve the capability of the model to simulate the effects of changing climate, CO2 and nitrogen on forest growth and WUE; (3) provide the first climate simulations until 2100 constrained by historical forest responses. The constrained projections will reduce uncertainties on the feedbacks of altered tree growth and physiology on climate.--> 

### OPEN POSITIONS
We have two positions open for CATES at this moment:

**Postdoc on tree-ring modelling (LSCE, Paris)**

We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher interested in tree-ring modeling to improve global land surface models. The overall goal of the position is to improve the biology and environmental sensitivity of biomass growth in the ORCHIDEE global land surface model (https://orchidee.ipsl.fr/) by introducing the process of wood formation, which underpins carbon sequestration and wood traits. This process is central to dendrochronology but is missing in current models.

The Postdoc will develop a module of wood formation (xylogenesis) and integrate it with recent developments to jointly represent [tree-ring width with water and carbon stable isotopes in ORCHIDEE](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/3781/2021/bg-18-3781-2021.html). Then, the improved model will be validated using multiple tree-ring data together with carbon and water fluxes. The pioneering research will improve the simulation and validation of the environmental sensitivity of woody biomass growth and density in a global model, enabling a better quantification of the climate feedbacks of altered tree growth and physiology with global changes. The position will be open until filled for a fixed-term period of 24 months, with a possible extension based on performance by up to two more years. 

The successful candidate should have excellent quantitative and scientific programming skills (Fortran, Linux, supercomputers), a PhD in an appropriated subject (ecology, environmental sciences, physics, mathematics, engineering or related fields), ability to work well with others and independently, good oral and written English skills. Modelling experience or process-based understanding of tree growth is highly desirable.

Applications should be submitted through the CNRS job portal [here](https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Offres/CDD/UMR8212-JONBAR-001/Default.aspx?lang=EN).

**Technician for tree-ring laboratory (LSCE, Paris)**

We are seeking a tree-ring lab technician for a fixed-term position of 36 months, with a possible extension based on performance. The position requires experience in laboratory techniques for stable isotopes, tissue processing or quantitative wood anatomy, and the ability to manage wood and sample collections, measure carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, measure samples for xylogenesis and assist during field campaigns and tree growth monitoring in Europe, US, and South America.
